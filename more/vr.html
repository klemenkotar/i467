       <p class="center-text">According to the Virtual Reality Society, Virtual Reality is a three-dimensional computer-generated environment which can be explored or interacted with by a person. Virtual reality is an experience created by computer that is really close to the reality or the environment we live in. The key of Virtual Reality is the immersiveness. Various elements in the Virtual Reality are supposed to make people feel immersed in the environment, such as lighting, viewing angle, and the responses users get by interacting with the environment. In other words, people would feel like they are actually in the environment.  <br><br>
