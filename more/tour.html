       <p class="center-text">HFS VR is a Virtual Reality tour of the new residence hall - the Willow Hall at UW. This is designed and implemented by INFO 467 students.  The purpose of it is to help prospective students who just got accepted to UW but don’t live in Seattle to take a tour in the new residence hall they applied for. It does not only save the money these students might spend on flight tickets or any other transportation fees, but also saves the time they might spend on traveling. This function could be very important to these students’ parents as they might also want to know more about the new environment their kids will be joining in. The second purpose of HFS VR is to provide a way to show students the residence hall that is still under construction. Most people express that they would like to see the apartments or rooms before they decide to live there, but it is nearly impossible to do for any residence halls that are not yet finished constructing. HFS VR is here to help.</p>
