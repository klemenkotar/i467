          Benefits (maybe we should spread these benefits out, under each source)
          <ul class="center-chart">
          <li>Increased user engagement: Prospective students and donors feel more connected to your university and will interact with your website longer.</li>
          <li>Improved attention: Viewers will pay better attention to the content because of virtual tours’ interactive elements.</li>
          <li>Knowledge retention: Prospects will remember the information they gleaned from your tour for longer periods of time because of the visual associations.
          Interaction: The very nature of interactivity makes it more compelling and instructive than passive activities.</li>
          <li>Lack of distraction: Users will be less likely to click away when something else catches their eye.
          Immediate engagement: Don’t give prospects a chance to find a reason to click away. Instead, grab their attention from the beginning.
          Hands-on approach: Increase information absorption and retention through a virtual tour’s hands-on components.</li>
          <li>Understanding: When you deliver complex or difficult information, users will comprehend it more readily through the visual and interactive experience.</li>
          <li>Learning style: Many people learn more easily when there’s a visual component. Additionally, virtual tours often incorporate audio, as well.</li>
          <li>Conversion: Research demonstrates that virtual tours lead to higher conversion rates for higher education institutions.</li>
          </ul>
