       <p class="center-text">There are a lot of factors prospective students consider after they get accepted to the colleges. The living environment is one of the most important factors that students and their parents consider. However, often times students are accepted to not only one college. Flying to multiple colleges for college visit is ridiculously expensive and time-consuming. HFS VR is designed to solve this problem. By using HFS VR, you can save the time and money spent on traveling for college visit. In reality, most of college residence halls are full and donâ€™t have a showroom. Thus, even if students visit the campus, they might not have the opportunity to see how the rooms look like. However, HFS VR can provide this opportunity to users, even for under-construction residence halls.</p>
