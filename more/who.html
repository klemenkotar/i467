       <p class="center-text">HFS VR is a Virtual Reality product that provide users a way to remotely “visit” the residence hall they want to or will live in. Via the HFS VR, users can walk around in anywhere in the room, such as the toilet room, shower room, and closet and get really good details on each space. Users can either access the product on a web browser or see it with Google Cardboard. This idea was proposed by a group of students in INFO 466. This quarter, the whole INFO 467 class is working on this project from multiple aspects. The class is divided into the development team and the design team. The development team mainly focuses on implementing the Virtual Reality tour on Unity and Blender. The design team is responsible for designing and developing a website that is used as a guideline for HFS VR. The design team is also in charge of doing market analysis on the product.</p>
